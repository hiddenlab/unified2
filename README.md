unified2: pure-python parser for IDS (think [Snort](http://snort.org)) unified2 binary log format
--------------------

Module allows to process IDS logs in binary "unified2" format into python
objects.

It does not resolve rule ids and is not meant to be a replacement for
[barnyard2](https://github.com/firnsy/barnyard2) or Snort itself in that role.

Main purpose is to extract a packet data from the log, associated with some
particular triggered (and resolved/logged separately via other means,
e.g. alert_syslog or alert_csv snort modules) rule, so I haven't paid much
attention to processing event metadata.

Module doesn't have C components and doesn't use ctypes, so should be fairly
portable to non-cPython language implementations.


Format
--------------------

Format definition is derived from Snort headers (src/sfutil/Unified2_common.h)
via [pyclibrary](https://code.launchpad.net/~luke-campagnola/pyclibrary) module
and are cached in unified2/_format.py file.

Newer definitions (say, if new data types were added) can be generated by
running the same script on the Snort's Unified2_common.h:

	bzr branch lp:pyclibrary
	cd pyclibrary
	python .../unified2/_format.py .../snort-2.X.Y.Z/src/sfutil/Unified2_common.h


Installation
--------------------

It's a regular package for Python 2.7 (not 3.X).

Using [pip](http://pip-installer.org/) is the best way:

	% pip install unified2

If you don't have it, use:

	% easy_install pip
	% pip install unified2

Alternatively ([see
also](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html)):

	% curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python
	% pip install unified2

Or, if you absolutely must:

	% easy_install unified2

But, you really shouldn't do that.

Current-git version can be installed like this:

	% pip install -e 'git://github.com/mk-fg/unified2.git#egg=unified2'


Usage
--------------------

Simple example:

	import sys, unified2.parser
	for pkt, pkt_tail in unified2.parser.parse(sys.argv[1]):
		print 'Packet:', pkt
		if pkt_tail: print 'Packet tail:', pkt_tail

unified2.parser.Parser interface is best illustrated by the unified2.parser.read
function:

	parser, buff_agg = Parser(), ''
	while True:
		buff = parser.read(src)
		if not buff: break # EOF
		while True:
			buff_agg, pkt = parser.process(buff_agg + buff)
			if pkt is None: break
			yield pkt

Idea here is that Parser.read method should be called with a stream (e.g. a file
object), returning however many bytes parser needs to get the next parseable
chunk of data (one packet, in case of u2 log) or whatever can be read at the
moment, empty string is usually an indication of EOF or maybe non-blocking read
return.

Parser.process then should be called with accumulated (by Parser.read calls)
buffer, returning the first packet that can be parsed from there (or None, if
buffer isn't large enough) and remaining (non-parsed) buffer data.
